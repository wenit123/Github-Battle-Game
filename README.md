 5. Start over  

## How to install
```
npm install
```

## How to run

and then open the browser at `http://localhost:8080`

## PS
This is my very first experiment in learning with React following the lovely free basic course from

stuff used:

- react  
- react-router  
- axios  
- re-base for connecting to Firebase  
- babel to transpile JSX and some ES6 to JS  
- webpack  
- style,css loader
